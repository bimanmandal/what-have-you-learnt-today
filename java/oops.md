### Explain the principles of object-oriented programming and how youâ€™ve applied them in your projects.
Answer: The four principles are:  

**Encapsulation:** Wrapping data (fields) and methods into a single unit, i.e., class. Example: Using private fields with public getter and setter methods.  \
**Inheritance:** Reusing code by inheriting properties from a parent class. Example: Extending a BaseController for common logic in Spring MVC.  \
**Polymorphism:** Ability for methods to take many forms, such as method overloading or overriding. Example: Implementing the Comparator interface for sorting.  \
**Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details from the user, e.g., using interfaces. Example: Defining service interfaces and implementing them in classes.

Difference between inheritance and composition?

Inheritance is a "is-a" relationship, e.g., Dog extends Animal. Changes in the parent class affect the child class.   \
Composition is a "has-a" relationship, e.g., Car has an Engine. It provides more flexibility by favoring interfaces.
